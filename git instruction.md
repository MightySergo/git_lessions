## What is git?
Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in any set of computer files. Git was created by Linus Torvalds during the Linux develpment. Git saves only the difference between files and not the entire files allowing git to save a considerable amount of memory.

## Repository
To start a new git repository follow the instruction below
1. Create a directory to contain the project
2. Go into the new directory
3. Open console
4. Type **git init** and execute the command (this will also create _master_ branch)
